# Overview

Web9c is a demo browser application to show that it is possible to create [Nine Chronicles]-related applications in a JavaScript/TypeScript environment.

In its current implementation, Web9c utilizes a WASM version of a game logic .NET library called Lib9c, called lib9c-wasm, and JavaScript libraries provided by a blockchain library called Libplanet.

We're currently deploying the app on https://web9c.netlify.app/, and if you're already playing Nine Chronicles, you can use your JSON Web3KeyStore file to play it. For instructions on how to play, check out Tutorial: How to transfer NCG.
